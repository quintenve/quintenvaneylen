### Hey, I'm Quinten Van Eylen

I'm a student in my first year of the graduate Programming at Thomas More. At this moment, I'm experienced with Java, HTML and CSS. I would really like to extend this list.

I graduated from high school with a degree in Sciences with 6 hours of math, which gives me a general basic knowledge. Thereafter I extended my knowledge in university studies Industrial sciences and Physical education and exercise sciences.

Next to my love for technology and programming, I'm passionate about the human body, sport and health.
